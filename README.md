# Hispathology_Image_Classification
The repo uses PyTorch and TensorFlow to perform Image Classification on Hispathological Data


## Intro

This is my first time working with the Histological Images. I gave this a try since I previously worked with CT Scan medical image classification.
These Image classifications in Medical Fields are extremely useful as early detection in the cell/tissue can prevent the life of a patient.

Not much of image analysis was performed, since its relatively new to me. With more detailed studies and reviewing more works and research papers, new analysis/ sub projects will be added in the project.

## Final Verdict:

Models and Notebooks have been provided. Feel free to test it out.
In the meantime, I will also do it alongside and improve

Thank you
